What is MonedaDelEmprendimiento?
----------------

MonedaDelEmprendimiento is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. MonedaDelEmprendimiento uses a proof-of-stake method in order for
the MonedaDelEmprendimiento blockchain network to achieve distributed consensus. MonedaDelEmprendimiento Core is
the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the
MonedaDelEmprendimiento Core software, see https://www.MonedaDelEmprendimiento.com/#wallet.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the MonedaDelEmprendimiento
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[MonedaDelEmprendimientoTalk forum](https://www.MonedaDelEmprendimientotalk.org/category/8/MonedaDelEmprendimiento-coincode)

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/MonedaDelEmprendimientoFoundation/MonedaDelEmprendimiento/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of MonedaDelEmprendimiento.

Translations
------------

We currently accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests but this may
change in the future when we start to use Transifex.
